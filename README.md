# 🏠 House Price Prediction System (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts house prices based on key property features. It demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable regression model that can estimate house prices with high accuracy and provide an interactive user interface for real-time predictions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Real estate pricing is influenced by multiple factors such as location, size, quality, and construction year. The objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: Ames Housing Dataset
- Features include:
  - Lot Area
  - Year Built
  - Overall Quality
  - Living Area
  - Basement Area
  - Garage Capacity
- Target Variable:
  - SalePrice

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Joblib

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection (high-impact features only)
3. Handling missing values using median imputation
4. Model training using Random Forest Regressor
5. Model evaluation using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
6. Model serialization using Joblib

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- R² Score: ~0.91
- MAE: ~15,000
- RMSE: ~26,000

The model shows strong predictive performance and generalization capability on unseen data.
